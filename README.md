## Project Goals

- To gain skill in reading literature and gathering facts about the described science.
- To gain experience in determining the onset of an ethical dilemma in a Discrete Structures research setting.
- To think critically about the outcome of the Discrete Structures research in terms of ethical handling, fairness, justice and accountability.
- To learn new ways to think about technology.

## Motivation

In the Netflix series, __Coding Explained__, the implications of computer code and algorithms, applied to our daily lives, are discussed as an ethical focus. In the documentary, it is speculated that the solutions from computer code and their embedded algorithms, may make our world into a better place, however these assets may still be the causes of many direct and indirect types of problems of an ethical nature.

For instance, as developers create new technologies, the video suggests that, while the code is tested for faults, the general usage of the technology in society may not be completely understood for proper testing.

## Part 1

__In this assignment__, you (working in a partner, if you choose) are to use online search engines to find up to three articles from journalism or scientific literature that discuss a specific _ethical problem_ that results from the usage of computational technology (i.e., the utilization of the technology creates unforeseen problems due to bias, violation of privacy, or similar). You will use the articles to introduce and present the ethical conundrum to the class. __Remember your study has to originate from your articles which clearly discuss the issue in some detail. Your work will be to present the matter to your class.__

For example, you could explore articles that discuss the cyber bullying, body-shaming and /or other undesirable qualities that have emerged from using social networking technologies. Another idea might concern the development of a technology that was designed for honest applications, however, the technology is often used for nefarious ends, which were not a part of the original design.

The abuse caused by technologies due to poor design and development may be another track that you could explore. Facial recognition, for example, was discussed in (Code of Ethics for Facial Recognition)[https://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/wfeess/article/view/7642/6832] by Caitlin Fisher. There are many potential project ideas available by searching keywords relating to ethical topics such as following; "computer crime", "security" ,"privacy", "misinformation (accuracy)", "liability", "responsibility", "intellectual property", "access" and many others.

Once you have located an appropriate article in which terms from computer science and ethics are mentioned together, you are to complete the reflection questions of your lab.

## Part 2

__Next lab__: You and your group partner are to present your research on an ethical problem stemming from code or algorithm-use from the article. In your presentation, you describe the articles, state the ethical concern and provide details about how the problem can be resolved. You are encouraged to provide your own ideas about how to prevent harm from being done. Your presentation will last up to ten minutes.

## Deliverables

- Write a reflection of about 200 words to describe the chosen article and the ethical implication outlined in it. The above-mentioned themes of Part 1 to consider are also to be addressed in your `writing/reflection.md` document.

- Present the material from your research to the class during the next lab. Note: Each person is expected to speak and to contribute equally to the group's effort.

## Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up to 25%]:**: For the lab repository associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes. This is only checking some baseline writing and commit requirements as well as correct inclusion of files. An additional reduction will be given if the commit log shows a cluster of commits at the end clearly used just to pass this requirement. An additional reduction will also be given if there is no commit during lab work times. All other requirements are evaluated manually.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up to 40%]:**: Students will also receive a check mark grade when the responses to the writing questions presented in the `reflection.md` reveal a proficiency of both writing skills and scientific knowledge. To receive a check mark grade, the submitted writing should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate answers.

- **Mastery of Oral Communication [up to 35%]**: Students will receive a portion of their assignment grade when the team presentation shows a complete understanding of the written work and ability to communicate its ideas.

## GatorGrade Checking

You can also use `gatorgrade` to check the baseline requirements of this assignment by running the following command in your terminal:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

If `gatorgrade` shows that all checks pass, you will know that you have met baseline requirements of this project.

## Submission

As you are working on your lab, you are to commit and push regularly. The commands are the following.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m ``Your notes about commit here''
git push
```

After you have pushed your work to your repository, please visit the repository at the GitHub website (you may have to log-in using your browser) to verify that your files were correctly sent.

## Seeking Assistance

Students who have questions about this project outside of the lab time are invited to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during instructor's or TL's office hours.
